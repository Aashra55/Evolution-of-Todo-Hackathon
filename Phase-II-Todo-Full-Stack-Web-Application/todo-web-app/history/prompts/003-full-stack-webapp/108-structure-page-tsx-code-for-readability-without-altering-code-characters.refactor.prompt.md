## Prompt

ab code ka ek letter bhi change kiye bagher page.tsx k code ko structure karo, unnecessary space remove kro but code ka ek letter bhi change nh hona chahiye

## Response snapshot

I have reformatted the `page.tsx` file by removing unnecessary blank lines and adjusting indentation, while ensuring that not a single character of the actual code was changed. This strictly adheres to the user's request for improving readability without altering code content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `page.tsx` file is now structured for improved readability, with unnecessary whitespace removed and consistent indentation, without any modification to the code's characters or functionality.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a code style/formatting change.
- 📁 Files: Modified page.tsx to improve code structure and readability (whitespace only).

- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully met a highly specific and challenging formatting request, demonstrating careful adherence to constraints. The task required a manual approach to avoid any unintended code modifications by automatic formatters.
