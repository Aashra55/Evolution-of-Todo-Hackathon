## Prompt

Whbat kind of WebGL is this, ye to bs center main এক circle agaya h koi animation koi khubsurti nh h

## Response snapshot

I have updated the `HeroWebGL.tsx` component to create a more dynamic and visually appealing background. This should address the user's feedback about the lack of animation and 'beauty' while maintaining the performance and subtle neon aesthetic.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The WebGL background animation is now more dynamic and visually engaging, addressing the user's feedback regarding its perceived lack of animation and beauty.
- 🧪 Tests: No explicit tests were added, but the visual outcome was verified.
- 📁 Files: Modified HeroWebGL.tsx to enhance animation.
- 🔁 Next prompts: " - "
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully enhanced the WebGL background animation by introducing multiple, dynamically moving blobs with varied properties. This improved visual complexity while maintaining performance, directly addressing the user's aesthetic concerns.
